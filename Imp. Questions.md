## Important Questions to look up before any SDE Interview.

Q-1 What is difference between Instance Variable and Class Variable.

Ans. Instance variables are variables used for data that is unique to a particular instance. 
Class Variables are variables that are shared by all instances of a class. So while instance variable can be unique for each instance like our name,email and pay; class variable should be the-same for each instance.
